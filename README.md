# GPS-locator
Most houses don't have a KNOWN address in Mali, so I created this to allow users to send their location to people who want to meet them.
Most people also don't know how to use the one available in Whatsapp messenger.
So, to make it easier for them. I simply send them the link to my website and tell them to click on the Green Button.

**Make a site

**Add your Discord webhook in code

**Send the link to the person you wish to visit

**Tell them (family member or friend) to click on the button so you can see where they are

**Check your Discord channel for the link to their location on Google Maps
